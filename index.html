		<h3>Appearance</h3>
		<p>The k&amacr;k&amacr;p&omacr;s is a large flightless <a href="index2.html">parrot</a> in New Zeleand.
		It is also known as the owl parrot, part of the Psittaciformes order that encompases all parrots.
		This beautiful bird is green all over with yellow and black spots speckled through its feathers.
		They don&rsquo;t have any living relatives, but the closest relative to k&amacr;k&amacr;p&omacr;s are <a href=
		"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kea">keas</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C4%81k%C4%81">
		k&amacr;k&amacr;s</a>.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Diet</h3>
		<p>They have a completely plant-based diet. As a bird that cannot fly, they climb
		their way up trees and search the ground for food like berries and leaves. They don&rsquo;t have any
		natural predators, but many have been introduced into the land that endangers their population.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Life Cycle</h3>
		<p>They have one of the longest lifespans of birds, living an average of 100 years.
		They are nocturnal.
		</p>
		
		<h2 id="Endangerment">Endagerment</h2>
		<h3>History and Reasons</h3>
		<p>There are a few reasons, mainly habitat loss and predation. When European settlers decided to colonize
		New Zeleand,
		they brought animals with them, such as rats and felines. These animals became either predators to
		the bird or attacked its eggs and young chicks when the mother left to find food. And of course,
		as more people settled on the land and grew their territories, the birds&rsquo; habitats began to disappear.
		All these troubles for the poor k&amacr;k&amacr;p&omacr;s have led their population to shrink down to only about
		150 of them left in the wild.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Effects</h3>
		<p>Low population has forced the k&amacr;k&amacr;p&omacr;s to inbreed. This has decreased the fertility rate
		of their eggs which puts their chance of survival into more risk.
